The first time you try to run "ansible-playbook" against multiple hosts, you will have a problem if they are not already in the ssh known hosts list. ALthough you see a prompt for "yes/no", it won't work.  You have to hit each of the hosts individually prior to this (no need to actually authenticate) just to get them on the list, and then everything will work. The book does not explain how to do this if there is a huge number of hosts.
